ValHeel Banker

Plugin to automate/shortcut some of the tasks involved managing the alternate currencies on the ValHeel private server.

This plugin will allow you to:

  1. Deposit/Withdraw pyreals, ashcoin and/or luminance on your characters.
  2. Maintain a list of your characters (or friends) to easily transfer currencies too.
  3. Auto bank pyreals or luminance on timer. Useful for when questing or hunting for prolonged periods of time to avoid capping your luminance and missing out.

Install by adding the DLL directly to Decal.

NOTE: This plugin will only show up and work on the ValHeel server.
